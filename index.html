    <p><b>Alice:</b> I'll enter the message, generate the signature and transmit it to Bob.</p>
    <p><b>Bob:</b> I can verify whether someone has tampered the original data and also I can verify if the sender is
      Alice or not. If I modify the received data the system will throw an error. You can try it yourself by editing the
      received text on my workspace.</p>
